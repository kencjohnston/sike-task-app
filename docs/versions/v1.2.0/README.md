## üîç Open Questions

The following questions need decisions before implementation:

1. **Search Indexing** (Priority: Medium)
   - Use in-memory filtering or build search index?
   - **Recommendation**: Start in-memory, add index if needed

2. **Archive Retention** (Priority: Low)
   - Maximum archive size or auto-cleanup?
   - **Recommendation**: No limits initially

3. **Streak Calculation** (Priority: High)
   - Calculate from history or start fresh?
   - **Recommendation**: Calculate from history

4. **Date Exclusions** (Priority: Low)
   - Include in v1.2.0 or defer to v1.3.0?
   - **Recommendation**: Defer to v1.3.0

**See**: [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md#open-questions--decisions-needed) for details.
