**Key Capabilities**:
- Archive completed tasks manually or automatically
- Browse archived tasks in dedicated view
- Restore archived tasks to active list
- Permanently delete from archive
- Auto-archive old completed tasks (configurable threshold)

**User Benefit**: Cleaner, more focused active task list without losing historical data. Essential for long-term task management.

**Technical Highlights**:

- Undo support for archive actions
- Bulk archive operations

**Documentation**: See [PLANNED.md](PLANNED.md#2-task-archiving) for full details.

- Track completion statistics (rate, on-time %, total completed)
- Gamified streaks (current streak, longest streak)
- Skip instances intentionally
- Reschedule individual instances
- Monthly calendar view of instances

**User Benefit**: Provides motivation through streaks, helps identify missed instances, and gives clear visibility into recurring task patterns.

**Technical Highlights**:

- **Monthly by weekday**: "First Monday", "Last Friday", etc.
- **Monthly by date**: "Day 15", "Last day", etc.
- **Date exclusions**: Skip specific dates (holidays, vacations)
- **Live preview**: See next 5 occurrences before saving

**User Benefit**: Handles real-world scheduling complexity that basic daily/weekly/monthly patterns can't accommodate.

**Technical Highlights**:

- Limited to 1000 results (pagination required beyond that)
- No saved search queries (search history only)

**Archive**:
- No export to external storage
- Archive size not automatically limited
- No archive statistics dashboard

**Recurring History**:
- Calendar view shows single month only (no year view)
- Statistics for >1000 instances may be slow
- No charts/graphs for trends

**Advanced Recurrence**:
- Date exclusions optional (can defer)
- No "nth weekday of month" (e.g., "2nd and 4th Monday")
- Timezone-naive (uses device local time)

### Deferred to v1.3.0

**Future Enhancements**:
- Push notifications for due dates
- Fuzzy search with typo tolerance
- Saved/pinned searches
- Archive export (JSON, CSV)
- Statistics charts and trends
- Bulk edit future recurring instances
- Timezone-aware recurrence
- Recurring task templates
- Calendar sync integration

---

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Questions for Stakeholder

1. **Search indexing**: Implement proper search index or use in-memory filtering?
   - Index: Faster (10-50ms), more complex, uses more memory
   - In-memory: Slower (100-300ms), simpler, less memory
   - **Recommendation**: Start in-memory, add index if performance insufficient

2. **Archive retention**: Should there be a maximum archive size or automatic cleanup?
   - Option A: No limits (keep everything)
   - Option B: Auto-delete after 1 year
   - Option C: Configurable retention (90/180/365 days)
   - **Recommendation**: No limits initially, add configurable cleanup in v1.3.0

3. **Streak calculation**: Calculate from all history or start fresh in v1.2.0?
   - Option A: Start fresh (currentStreak = 0)
   - Option B: Calculate from existing instances (more accurate but complex)
   - **Recommendation**: Option B for better user experience

4. **Advanced recurrence**: Include date exclusions in v1.2.0 or defer to v1.3.0?
   - Include now: More feature-complete but adds complexity
   - Defer: Faster delivery, simpler initial release
   - **Recommendation**: Defer to v1.3.0 unless user strongly requests

5. **Archive auto-cleanup**: Should archived tasks >1 year old auto-delete?
   - Yes: Keeps database lean
   - No: Preserves all history
   - **Recommendation**: No auto-delete, but offer manual "Clear old archives" option

### Decisions Made

‚úÖ **Confirmed**:
- All new fields nullable/optional (backward compatibility)
- Automatic migration on app startup
- Search debounce at 300ms
- Archive swipe actions for quick access
- Streak tracking for motivation
- Preview for advanced recurrence verification
