## Known Issues

### Current Limitations (Not Bugs)

The following are intentional limitations documented in FEATURES.md, not bugs:

**Due Dates:**
1. Due dates are date-only (no time of day) - By design
2. Dates stored in device local time (not UTC-aware) - Future enhancement
3. No push notifications for due dates - Future enhancement
4. No calendar view - Future enhancement

**Repeating Tasks:**
1. Subtasks cannot be recurring - By design for simplicity
2. Recurring tasks require due dates - By design for proper scheduling
3. No timezone-aware recurrence - Future enhancement
4. No instance history view - Future enhancement
5. Changes to recurring tasks don't propagate - By design to preserve completed instances
